You can see a video about groups [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1eI8-pEK8g)

####Grouping is how we centralize hub URLs and github repose
* When logging into the site you should have a group that your are apart of

* If you are unsure you can check on the profile link to verify which group(s) you are in

* Once you have clicked on a group you will see which URLs you belong in/have access to


There are a few videos about URLs and Grouping
