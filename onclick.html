<h2>Click on element with onclick handler</h2>

<p><img src="images/onclick.png" alt="oc" title=""></p>

<p>This one will most likely be replace by <a href="press_click.html">Press/Click</a></p>

<p>Otherwise feel free to use it since even if it is removed from the UI those tests will still work.</p>
