## Exceptions, Errors and Tips


I will try and save common exceptions here.

Some tips.

### The Element is not found 

This can come down to a few things

  * Is it hidden via a display none?
  * Is it covered by another element via z-index?
  * Is it not a link or button 
  * Lastly but rare it out of view on the page.
  
In some cases I will try an xpath or use the "And I press the element "/div/x/yz/"
