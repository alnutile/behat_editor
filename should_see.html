<h2>Should or Should not see</h2>

<p><img src="images/see.png" alt="see" title=""></p>

<p>This is to find text on a page. Keep in mind some text might not be text or not be as you see it.
For example you may have 
<code>html
&lt;h1&gt;hello&lt;/h1&gt; there
</code></p>

<p>And you are trying to see "hello there"
it may not work. So always check the source.</p>

<p>Also for input fields use the </p>

<p><img src="images/see_field.png" alt="see field" title=""></p>

<p>And for elements like classes etc check</p>

<p><em>Then I see this element exists</em></p>
