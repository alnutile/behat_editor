<h2>Numbered Button</h2>

<p><img src="images/number_button.png" alt="# Button" title=""></p>

<p>Some pages have buttons with the same ID, Name and Label.
Before we had the <a href="press_click.html">Press Click Element Located At</a> we used this.</p>

<p>For now it is still there and when it is removed tests will still work with this.</p>
