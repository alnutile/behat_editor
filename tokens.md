## Tokens

This will allow you to use one set of goals for domain 1 for domain 2

For example JanRain log in maybe the same for all sites but a different language.

Site 1 would use this token set

'Click Submit': 'lorem impsum'

Site 2 would use this token set
'Click Submit': 'foo bar foo'

When the domain URL is chosen to run the test then this token set will be used.
Or you can click the "use this test?" button as well.
