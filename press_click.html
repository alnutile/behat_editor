<p>This collection of boxes helps to deal with different combinations of elements.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h5>Follow</h5>

<p>This is how you typically would "Follow" a link eg click and go to that page. This works well for a default.</p>

<h5>Click</h5>

<p>Sometimes Follow will not work due to Javascript or cause the element really is not a link but a list element that is being treated like a link for example.</p>

<h5>Press</h5>

<p>This is mainly for buttons</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<p>Choose the type of target</p>

<p>See <a href="target.html">Choose Target</a></p>

<p>Chrome has this built in. So if you right click and Inspect the element then go down to the Console and click there you can get it. </p>
