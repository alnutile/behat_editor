## Follow/Press/Click

![Press-Click](images/press_click.png)

This collection of boxes helps to deal with different combinations of elements.


####Step 1

#####Follow

This is how you typically would "Follow" a link eg click and go to that page. This works well for a default.

#####Click

Sometimes Follow will not work due to Javascript or cause the element really is not a link but a list element that is being treated like a link for example.

#####Press

This is mainly for buttons


***

####Step 2

Choose the type of target

See [Choose Target](target.html)


Chrome has this built in. So if you right click and Inspect the element then go down to the Console and click there you can get it.
