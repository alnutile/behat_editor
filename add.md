## Adding a Test

When you visit 

[Admin Index](admin/behat/index)

You can click the "Add Test" button

Once you do that you are in the Behat Editor.


From here you can Run tests but not until you click "Save Test" can you be sure your test will last. 

Make sure to follow the proper order of making a test

Here are the help docs in order of how you should progress

  * [Add a Feature name](feature.html)
  * [Add at least one Scenario](scenario.html)
  * [Add a URL to correct way](given.html)
  

Visit the Index page as well to see the videos with tutorials as well.
