<h2>##Groups</h2>

<p>You can see a video about groups <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1eI8-pEK8g">here</a></p>

<h4>Grouping is how we centralize hub URLs and github repose</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>When logging into the site you should have a group that your are apart of</p></li>
<li><p>If you are unsure you can check on the profile link to verify which group(s) you are in</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have clicked on a group you will see which URLs you belong in/have access to</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few videos about URLs and Grouping</p>
