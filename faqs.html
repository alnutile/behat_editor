<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>Why can I not make banners rotate</h2>

<p>Banners can work. One trick is that many banners do not rotate if the mouse is hovering over them, which it is the moment you click one.</p>

<p>So if possible make your next step</p>

<pre><code>And I fill in "search" with "test"
</code></pre>

<p>Or some other form field to get your mouse away from the banner</p>

<h2>Can I do Captcha</h2>

<p>No. It would make this way to good as a spamming tool. We are working though
on ways to allow people to bypass captchas as needed when using this tool.</p>

<h2>Can I use xpath</h2>

<p>Yes. Make sure to replace double quote with single quote.</p>

<p>So</p>

<pre><code>"//*[@id="knowpneumonia.com"]"
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes</p>

<pre><code>"//*[@id='knowpneumonia.com']"
</code></pre>

<h2>How do I add comments.</h2>

<p>Version 2 of the tool will be better about this.</p>

<p>You just use the # symbol here is an example</p>

<pre><code>Feature: Show a comment
  Scenario: Step 1
  # And this step is not seen by the system
  Given I am on "/"
  # or you can just type a comment to help others read your test
</code></pre>

<h2>How can I get help</h2>

<h2>Where do I store my files</h2>
<p>The repo should have a root folder called tests. In there is behat. Place your files in there</p>

<h2>When do I use Tokens</h2>

<p>They are a good way to build easy to read tests. Like this</p>

<pre><code>And I click "THE SAVE BUTTON'
</code></pre>

<p>Versus</p>

<pre><code>And I click the xpath "//*[@id='knowpneumonia.com']"
</code></pre>

<p>Also they are a good way to reuse a test. Say one site is English and the other Spanish. You could write one test with tokens.</p>

<h2>Can I add custom steps</h2>

<p>We are working on the best way to do this. Post some feedback to the Feedback tab and we can talk about how to work your steps into the site.</p>

<p>It really is easy overall. Behat is very extendable.</p>
