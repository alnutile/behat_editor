#####If you need to add a user to the system visit [Admin People](/admin/people) and click on the "add the user" link. 

Then follow these steps

* enter user name
* enter email address
* enter password
* click on active status
* use the tester role option (so they can be apart of the testing work flow)

###Once the user is made:  

* Go back to edit that user
* Be sure to put them in a group
* NOT the 'group audience' group. Put in the group membership group.
