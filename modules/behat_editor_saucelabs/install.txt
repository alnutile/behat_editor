After you enable the module you will need to visit composer_manager [admin/config/system/composer-manager]
and allow it to rebuild composer.json from the composer.json file in this modules folder.

After that you need to put your Saucelabs info into the admin area here
[admin/config/system/behat-editor/sauce-labs]

You can get your API on the lower left of the screen once you log in on the Dashboard.
