After you enable the module you will need to visit composer_manager [admin/config/system/composer-manager]
and allow it to rebuild composer.json from the composer.json file in this modules folder.

After that you need to put your Saucelabs info into the settings.php file

At the end of the file just add this
$conf['saucelabs'] = array('username' => 'YOU', 'api' => 'LONG STRING HERE');

You can get your API on the lower left of the screen once you log in on the Dashboard.
