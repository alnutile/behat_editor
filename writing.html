<h2>Writing a test</h2>

<p>You will see with each step (soon) a read more link or icon. If you open this by clicking on it you will see some info about that step and how to use and maybe an example test.</p>

<p>When you make a test you need to Save it or else it will not be saved after you leave the page.</p>

<p>When you Save a test it will redirect you to Edit mode.</p>

<p>Later in admin/index you can again View or Edit the test.</p>

<p>A test should not have a URL. Use the (url feature)[https://github.com/alnutile/behat_editor/blob/gh-pages/urls.md] to see how to manage that.</p>

<p>If you have a Repo you can always save to a repo. see the (repo feature)[https://github.com/alnutile/behat_editor/blob/gh-pages/repos.md] for more info on that.</p>
