<h1>Github Workflow</h1>

<p>The test files are stored in git. You can have numerous repos setup.</p>

<p>So in the admin interface you might see</p>

<p>|Repo Name | Repo Branch | Related Group |View Tests |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| repo<em>foo |    master   |    Team Foo   |   view    |
| repo</em>foo |    dev      |    Team Foo   |   view    |
| repo_foo |    prod     |    Team Foo   |   view    |</p>

<p>Assuming you are on Team Foo that team has 3 entries for 1 repo.
Each repository is set up to use a different branch.</p>

<p>If you were to look at the admin interface for editing or setting up a repository it is there that you can choose the branch and the folder. Actually in the admin interface seen above you can even edit it</p>

<p>With  this set of teams can work locally on different branches and then push to origin. The website will then show the files in that branch so you can run a test or see on the tests  in the related reports.</p>
