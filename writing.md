##Writing a test

You will see with each step (soon) a read more link or icon. If you open this by clicking on it you will see some info about that step and how to use and maybe an example test.

When you make a test you need to Save it or else it will not be saved after you leave the page.

When you Save a test it will redirect you to Edit mode.

Later in admin/index you can again View or Edit the test.


A test should not have a URL. Use the (url feature)[https://github.com/alnutile/behat_editor/blob/gh-pages/urls.md] to see how to manage that.

If you have a Repo you can always save to a repo. see the (repo feature)[https://github.com/alnutile/behat_editor/blob/gh-pages/repos.md] for more info on that.
