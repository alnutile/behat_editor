##Writing a test

You will see with each step (soon) a read more link or icon. If you open this by clicking on it you will see some info about that step and how to use and maybe an example test.

When you make a test you need to Save it or else it will not be saved after you leave the page.

When you Save a test it will redirect you to Edit mode.

Later in admin/index you can again View or Edit the test.

A test should not have a URL. Use the (url feature)[https://github.com/alnutile/behat_editor/blob/gh-pages/urls.md] to see how to manage that.

If you have a Repo you can always save to a repo. see the (repo feature)[https://github.com/alnutile/behat_editor/blob/gh-pages/repos.md] for more info on that.

##Tips

Try and try again.
Some times Follow may not work, then try Click, then try Press. Some times pages are just hard due to tricky HTML or JS based Select lists that you think are regular select lists etc. You just need to try different approaches and in the end there are about 2-3 and out of those you will get it.

Try it in Chrome and if it works there then suffer through IE.

##What is not working, yet

Basic Auth

IE is the only one not working right now. But that is not behat just the way URL was implemented. This will be fixed soon.
