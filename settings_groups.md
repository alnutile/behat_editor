## Settings for Groups 

![Settings Group](images/settings_group.png)

This allows you to choose the URL needed for you or your Group to run the test from.

Test should be relative URL based then you will use this to set the URL.

### Admin URLS

You can administer urls [here](/admin/behat/settings/base_url/groups)

If your url needs basic auth all you need to do is add it like this

http://username:password@test.com

The password will need to pass %40 if there is an @ symbol in it.
