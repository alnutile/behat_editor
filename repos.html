<h1>Repositories Setup</h1>

<p>-
 Now that you have the URLs in groups you can start setting up your repositories</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>You can see a video about this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3ko6E3DB0s">here</a></strong></p>

<h2>Repo Setup "Where should I place my tests"</h2>

<p>your repo should have a folder called tests
In there will be a folder called behat. Place your tests in there.</p>

<p>This folder may later have unit test, functional tests etc so we are adding the behat folder for your test.feature files.</p>

<p>~~~
//root of your repo
tests/behat/test.feature
~~~</p>

<h2>This module comes with a github module so that you can connect to the API</h2>

<p>&rarr; Go to the admin index</p>

<p>&rarr; Find the 'Github API setting</p>

<p>&rarr; Click on Github API link </p>

<p>&rarr; To access enter your Github user name and password</p>

<h4>Here is where you would start setting up the repos for your group</h4>

<p>&rarr; Click on the Github Repos in the Github Repos for Group Section</p>

<p>&rarr; Click on Add new Repo</p>

<p>&rarr; Choose the repo you would want to clone locally</p>

<p>&rarr; Assign it to a group and choose which folder those tests are in and then click ADD </p>

<h5>NOTE: That folder should exist prior to using the repository</h5>

<pre><code>This will download that repo for all users in that group as well as the group
</code></pre>

<p>It will show you the path it created for the group and users of the group
* The first path will contain a number which is the group ID number 
* The second path will also contain a number which is the number of users in the group who have access to the repo (See Image Below)</p>

<p>Finally when you go back to admin test and search for the folder name you will see that repo in place under module/folder and here all the tests that are in that folder will be viewable. </p>
